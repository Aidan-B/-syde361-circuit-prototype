# SYDE 361 - Group 2 Circuit Prototype
The software for the teensy based environment monitoring system done as part of SYDE 361 during spring 2022 by Group 2. This includes Abby Chan, Adam Linton, Aidan Bowers, Emily Louie, and Keaton Lees.

The aim of the project was to:

    Design and test a personal environmental monitoring system and data visualization/storytelling experience aimed at educating engineering students about their relationship to the environments they experience as a student.

This repository houses the teensy code and circuit schematics for the system.
